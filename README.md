# Trivia-Battle-Game
- WORK INTEGRATED PROJECT

<p>The application will be developed for the iOS mobile platform (SwiftUI) and it will consist of a game in which users will have to answer a series of questions in order to reduce the life bar and defeat their enemy. Users will have the possibility to sign up and sign in and all the collected information of the user will be collected with the features of authentication and Firestore Database of Firebase.</p>
  
<p>Firebase will be used for allowing the user to create their account with an email and password; the app will check if the information is valid, in case of error or lack of information the app will show an alert informing that it is required to fill all the boxes and give the correct information. Additionally, the feature of Firestore Database will be used, this feature will allow us to store the user information and history of games. Using the collected information of the collections the app will present a profile option where users will be able to see their game record, energy, materials, equipment levels, and the user's basic information.</p>
  
<p>Once the profile is created, the user will be able to choose their champion from a list of various heroes (the user will be able to change their champion every time they start a new game). Once the champion has been chosen, the user can go to the level screen which contains a list of enemies to choose from. Once they select the level, the application will navigate the user to the game screen in which for each correct answer the life bar of the enemy will reduce, as well as for each incorrect answer the life bar of the champion will be reduced. Once the enemy is defeated, the user will earn random materials which the user can later use to upgrade their equipements. If the user lose, then the app will navigate the user back to the champion selection screen without gaining any materials. Regardless of the game result, one energy will be deducted for each game.</p>

<p>There are advertisements in the level selection screen and when the user enter a game. The user can check their performance statics such as the percnetage of correct answers from the profile screen. The profile screen also shows their currently selected champion and the highest level the user had completed. The user can also logout and change their information through the profile screen</p>
